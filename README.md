# Linear-Regression

## Linear regression in python
Linear regression is a statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The goal of linear regression is to find the "best-fitting" line through a set of data points. This line can then be used to make predictions about future values of the dependent variable, given new values of the independent variable(s). In simple linear regression, there is one independent variable, whereas in multiple linear regression, there are two or more independent variables. Linear regression assumes that the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear.
