# Linear-Regression

## Linear regression in python
Linear regression is a statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The goal of linear regression is to find the "best-fitting" line through a set of data points. This line can then be used to make predictions about future values of the dependent variable, given new values of the independent variable(s). 
## Dependencies for implementing linear regression from scracth
The dependencies for running code in Python for simple linear regression are similar to those for linear regression in general. Here is a list of libraries and modules that you may need to import in order to perform simple linear regression in Python:

**numpy**: This library provides support for arrays and matrices, which are used to represent the data for simple linear regression. You would need to import numpy for mathematical calculations such as mean, standard deviation, dot product, matrix inversion etc.

**pandas**: This library is used for data manipulation and analysis. It can be used to load and manipulate the data, and also perform basic summary statistics on the data.

**matplotlib or seaborn** : These libraries are used for visualization, to plot the regression line on a scatter plot.

Other than these libraries, you may also need some of the standard Python libraries like math, statistics, csv etc. that provides basic functionality like mathematical operations, statistical measures and reading csv file etc.

'''import pandas as pd
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt'''
